# About me
I am a researcher with broad interets in human-computer interaction and artificial intelligence. I am currently pursuing a doctorate in Computer Science at EPFL, where I work with [Pearl Pu](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/gr-pu/members/pearl-pu/), studying social conversational agents, also known as chatbots. My research focuses on understanding what qualities make chatbots compelling to users, and how to evaluate them. To achieve this, I approach my work from a user-centered perspective, with a focus on theoretical conceptualization, experimental design, and evaluation. Thanks to my interdisciplinary background, I have a unique set of skills that allows me to collaborate effectively with professionals from various fields.
