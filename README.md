## About me
I am a researcher with broad interets in human-computer interaction and artificial intelligence. I am currently pursuing a doctorate in Computer Science at EPFL, where I work with Pearl Pu, studying social conversational agents, also known as chatbots. My research focuses on understanding what qualities make chatbots compelling to users, and how to evaluate them. To achieve this, I approach my work from a user-centered perspective, with a focus on theoretical conceptualization, experimental design, and evaluation. Thanks to my interdisciplinary background, I have a unique set of skills that allows me to collaborate effectively with professionals from various fields.
